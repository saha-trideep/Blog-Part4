        <p>Hi, I am Trideep Saha, I am a graduate in Physics and have been working in a production warehouse since 2016. I discover my passion for web development while taking a Python course in Udemy, it was my first step towards my career, and I am excited to exploring , learning and working in this field.</p>
        <p>With the knowledge that I gained from this course, I built this project, my first hands-on blog site. It allows user to create blog posts and comment on other userâ€™s post, all while using a tool called CKEditor to upload images.  Each user is also identified by a unique Gravatar image.</p>
        <p>I used Flask 2.2.2, a lightweight Python web framework, and Flask-SQLALchemy, a SQL toolkit, later on upgrade SQLite to PostgreSQL, for the backend. For the front-end, I utilized Bootstrap-Flask and Bootstrap 4 to create a responsive design.</p>
        <p>I am excited to continue work on this project to make it more user-friendly and visual appealing.
        Some features I plane on adding in future include dynamic presentation, threaded comments, email subscription, and search engine optimization. I am thrilled to be starting my journey as a web developer and I am eager to continue learning and growing in this field.
